## Inspiration:
        I go to a large public school where college sports are a big thing. Students get tickets for free, but the amount of students are much greater than the
        amount of seats available. I realized I could claim the tickets and then resell them on social media. However, I usually am late to claiming the tickets
        and they sell out. I decided to make a program that uses the Twilio python extension that has access to sending SMS and the imaplib libary which can access               emails.    
        
        
### Process:
        The process initially was very confusing. I first had to create a twilio account and get my twilio phone number which would message my actual phone number.
        I then had to research how to import twilio, and the functions that come with the libary. After that, I had to learn how to utilize the imaplib library to               connect to my school email that receives the student tickets notification.
