Inspiration:
        I go to a large public school where college sports are a big thing. Students get tickets for free, but the amount of students are much greater than the
        amount of seats available. I realized I could claim the tickets and then resell them on social media. However, I usually am late to claiming the tickets
        and they sell out. I decided to make a program that uses the Twilio python extension that has access to emails and SMS. The program would send a text message
        to my phone number whenever an email containing a keyword "Student Ticket" is sent to my school email.
